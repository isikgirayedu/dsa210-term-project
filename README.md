## Overview of Project

The present project tries to analyze the change of food prices over time in Turkey and the relation of the trends with inflation and change in the exchange rate.

In this project, trends will be explored, relationships between different food categories visualized, and a simple predictive model built for future prices, all using publicly available datasets from TÜİK, Numbeo, and Kaggle.

---

## Goals

- Analyze the rate of increases in food prices from 2019–2025.  
- Compare various product categories: bread, milk, meat, fruits, etc.  
- Analyze the relations between food prices, inflation rate, and changes in currency.  
- Apply regression-based machine learning to predict future food prices.

## Planned Sources for Data

| Source | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **TÜİK (Turkish Statistical Institute)** | Monthly food price index |
| **Numbeo** | Average food prices per city |
| **Kaggle Dataset** | Global inflation and currency data for enrichment |

All data sources will be open and combined into one unified dataset for analysis.

## Planned Methods

- Cleaning and integrating data with **pandas**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Statistical analysis: correlation, t-tests  
- Visualization with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**  
- Regression-based ML for price prediction using **scikit-learn**

| **28 Nov** | Collect data and do EDA + hypothesis tests |
| **02 Jan** | Apply ML methods |
| **09 Jan** | Final project submission |
