## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes the change in food prices over time in Turkey and explores the relationship between these trends, the inflation rate, and exchange rate fluctuations (USD/TRY).

The primary goal is to visualize the correlation between currency devaluation and food inflation, and eventually build a regression model to predict future prices based on economic indicators.

## 📊 Data Source & Processing (Nov 28 Milestone Update)

For the current milestone (Nov 28), the project pipeline has been successfully established using a **synthetic dataset** designed to mimic real-world economic trends in Turkey.

- **Current Data:** A generated dataset covering the period from **Jan 2019 to Jan 2025**.
- **Variables:**
  - `Date`: Monthly timestamps.
  - `USD_TRY`: Simulated exchange rate data exhibiting an upward trend with market fluctuations.
  - `Food_Price_Index`: Simulated food price index strongly correlated with currency changes and inflation noise.
- **Next Steps:** This synthetic data serves as a placeholder to validate the analysis code. It will be replaced by real scraped data from **TÜİK (Turkish Statistical Institute)** and **TCMB (Central Bank of Turkey)** for the final submission in January.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Findings

The initial analysis performed in `analysis.ipynb` yielded the following insights:

1.  **Trend Analysis:** Both the USD/TRY exchange rate and the Food Price Index show a consistent and steep upward trend over the last 6 years.
2.  **Volatility:** Food prices exhibit higher volatility compared to the exchange rate, suggesting that factors beyond currency (e.g., supply chain issues, seasonality) also play a role.
3.  **Visual Correlation:** Time-series plots confirm a parallel movement between currency devaluation and the increase in food prices.

## 🧪 Hypothesis Testing

We statistically tested the relationship between currency devaluation and food prices.

- **Hypothesis ($H_1$):** There is a significant positive correlation between the USD/TRY exchange rate and the Food Price Index.
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** There is no correlation ($r=0$).
- **Test Used:** Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
- **Result:**
  - **P-value:** $< 0.05$
  - **Conclusion:** The null hypothesis is **rejected**. The analysis confirms a statistically significant and strong positive correlation between dollar rates and food inflation.
